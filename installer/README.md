# TrustSign Windows Installer

This folder contains the Inno Setup script to build a Windows installer for TrustSign. The installer packages **the same files as the client folder** (`build/client`): JAR, `run-trustsign.bat`, `config/` (config.json, public-key.pem, truststore.jks, SET-PIN.txt), README.txt, and bundled JRE.

- **Bundled JRE**: Eclipse Temurin 17 JRE for Windows x64 — the client does **not** need to install Java.
- **Same as zip client**: `./gradlew buildInstaller` first runs `clientFolderWindows`, then packages `build/client` into the .exe. So the installed app matches what you get from zipping `build/client`.
- **Run at startup**: Optional task "Run TrustSign when Windows starts" creates a shortcut in the Startup folder.
- **Shortcuts**: Start menu and optional desktop shortcut to run TrustSign.

## What's in this folder

- **TrustSign.iss** – Inno Setup script (packages `build/client`).
- **config.json** – Optional config override; the client package prefers `config/config.json` (see build.gradle).

## Prerequisites (for building the installer)

1. **Java 17+** and **Gradle** (to build the app).
2. **Inno Setup 6** ([download](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)). Install to the default path so Gradle finds `ISCC.exe`, or add it to PATH.

## Build the installer

1. From the project root:

```bash
./gradlew buildInstaller
```

The installer is created at:

**`build/installer/TrustSign-0.1.0-Setup.exe`**

2. Give the client:
   - **`TrustSign-0.1.0-Setup.exe`**
   - **`activation-key.txt`** (the one-time activation key — deliver this separately)

The client runs the installer, places `activation-key.txt` in the `config/` folder, and starts TrustSign. The app activates on first launch by contacting the licensing server, then runs fully offline.

If you don't have Inno Setup, you can still give clients the same content as a zip:

- Cross-platform package (requires Java on client): `./gradlew clientFolderCrossPlatform`
- Windows package with bundled JRE: `./gradlew clientFolderWindows`

## What to give the client

1. **TrustSign-0.1.0-Setup.exe** – the installer (same content as `build/client`, including bundled JRE).
2. Or zip **build/client** and give that instead; they run `run-trustsign.bat`.
3. **activation-key.txt** – always delivered separately from the installer.

Config is in `{InstallDir}\config\` (config.json, public-key.pem, etc.).

## Production Config Recommendation

For production deployments, start from `config/config.production.json` (project root) instead of dev-style configs.

- Copy it to your deployment config location as `config.json`.
- Set strict values for:
  - `allowedOrigins`
  - `allowedClientIps`
  - `server.maxTcpConnections`
  - `server.maxConcurrentSigningOperations`
- Keep `server.enableDebugEndpoints` as `false`.
- Keep `pkcs11.pin` as `null` and provide PIN through `TRUSTSIGN_TOKEN_PIN`.

Use either Gradle property (-P...) or environment variable before running the task.

Option 1: pass directly with -P (easy one-time)
macOS package:
./gradlew clientFolderMac -PmacJreSha256="<your-mac-jre-sha256>"
Linux package:
./gradlew clientFolderLinux -PlinuxJreSha256="<your-linux-jre-sha256>"
Option 2: export env vars (good for repeated runs / CI)
export TRUSTSIGN_MAC_JRE_SHA256="<your-mac-jre-sha256>"
export TRUSTSIGN_LINUX_JRE_SHA256="<your-linux-jre-sha256>"
Then run:

./gradlew clientFolderMac
./gradlew clientFolderLinux
In CI (GitHub Actions example)
Store both hashes as secrets, then:

env:
  TRUSTSIGN_MAC_JRE_SHA256: ${{ secrets.TRUSTSIGN_MAC_JRE_SHA256 }}
  TRUSTSIGN_LINUX_JRE_SHA256: ${{ secrets.TRUSTSIGN_LINUX_JRE_SHA256 }}
and run Gradle tasks normally.

How to get the SHA256 value
From terminal after download URL (or file):

macOS/Linux:
shasum -a 256 "<file>"
Use the first hex string as <sha256>.
Exactly — it downloads first, then needs the checksum for verification.

You can generate hash from the downloaded file (now present in build/jre-mac/).

Use this:

./gradlew printSha256 -Pfile="build/jre-mac/temurin17-jre-mac-x64.tar.gz"
